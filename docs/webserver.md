# Web Server Guide

The built-in web server provides file upload and management through Wi-Fi.

## Overview

PapyriX Reader includes a built-in web server that lets you:

- Upload books through WiFi from a device on the same WiFi network
- Browse and manage files on the SD card of your device
- Create folders to organize your ebooks
- Delete files and folders
- Upload and manage custom sleep screen images
- Upload custom fonts and font themes

## Prerequisites

- Your PapyriX Reader device
- A WiFi network
- A computer, phone, or tablet connected to the **same WiFi network**

---

## Step 1: Accessing File Transfer

1. From the Home screen, open **Apps** and select **File Transfer**.
2. The device starts a scan for available networks.

---

## Step 2: Connecting to WiFi

### Viewing Available Networks

After the scan completes, you see a list of available WiFi networks with these indicators:

- **Signal strength bars** (`||||`, `|||`, `||`, `|`) - Shows connection quality
- **`*` symbol** - Shows that the network has a password (encrypted)
- **`+` symbol** - Shows that you saved credentials for this network before

### Selecting a Network

1. Use the **Left/Right** (or **Volume Up/Down**) buttons to go through the network list.
2. Press **Confirm** to select the highlighted network.

### Entering Password (for encrypted networks)

If the network needs a password:

1. An on-screen keyboard shows with a full character grid.
2. The keyboard is organized in zones:
   - **Rows 1-3:** Lowercase letters (a-z) and usual symbols (. - _ @)
   - **Rows 4-6:** Uppercase letters (A-Z) and symbols (! # $ %)
   - **Row 7:** Numbers (0-9)
   - **Row 8:** More symbols (^ & * ( ) + [ ] \)
   - **Bottom row:** SPACE and BACKSPACE controls
3. Use **Up/Down/Left/Right** to move on the grid.
4. Press **Confirm** to enter the selected character.
5. Press **Back** to cancel and go back.

**Note:** If you connected to this network before, the saved password is used.

### Connection Process

The device shows "Connecting..." while it makes the connection. This usually takes 5-10 seconds.

### Saving Credentials

If this is a new network, the device asks you to save the password:

- Select **Yes** to save credentials for automatic connection the next time (NOTE: These are stored as plaintext on the SD card of the device. Do not use this for networks that are sensitive.)
- Select **No** to connect with no save

---

## Step 3: Connection Success

After the connection, the screen shows:

- **Network name** (SSID)
- **IP Address** (for example, `192.168.1.102`)
- **Web server URL** (for example, `http://192.168.1.102/`)

**Important:** Record the IP address. You need this to open the web interface from your computer or phone.

---

## Step 4: Accessing the Web Interface

### From a Computer

1. Connect the computer to the **same WiFi network** as the reader.
2. Open a web browser.
3. Type the IP address shown on your device into the address bar of the browser.
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Press Enter.

### From a Phone or Tablet

1. Connect the phone or tablet to the **same WiFi network** as the reader.
2. Open your mobile browser (Safari, Chrome, or other).
3. Type the IP address into the address bar.
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.102/`
4. Tap Go.

### Books Tab

The Books tab is the default view. It shows files and folders on the SD card root.

- **Folders** are shown with an orange **DIR** badge and a trash icon
- **Files** show their size (for example, "1.2 MB") and a trash icon
- Click a folder name to go into it
- The path breadcrumb (for example, "SD" or "/books") shows the current location

#### Uploading Books

1. Click the **Upload** button.
2. In the dialog, click **Choose File** and select a file.
3. Click **Upload**.
4. The page refreshes when the upload completes.

![Upload dialog (Books)](images/web-upload-books.png)

**Supported book formats:** `.epub`, `.fb2`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.xtc`, `.xtch`, `.xtg`, `.xth`, `.txt`, `.text`, `.md`, `.markdown`

**Supported image formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`

**Note:** Files with uppercase extensions (for example, `Book.EPUB`) are changed to lowercase on upload. Unsupported file types are rejected.

#### Creating Folders

1. Click the **New Folder** button.
2. Enter a supported folder name.
3. Click **Create**.

![New Folder dialog](images/web-new-folder.png)

This is useful to organize your ebooks by genre, author, or series.

#### Deleting Files and Folders

1. Click the trash icon adjacent to a file or folder.
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog.

**Warning:** Web File Manager deletion is permanent. You cannot reverse it. The **Recycle bin** setting of the device only
has an effect on deletion from the Files screen on the device.

**Note:** Web File Manager folders must be empty before you can delete them. Use the Files screen on the device to delete
a folder that is not empty.

### Unicode filenames

Folder create, upload, and rename support UTF-8 names in Latin (including Vietnamese), Cyrillic, Greek, Thai, and Arabic. Names are changed to NFC before storage.

Web mutations reject:

- control characters and `" * / : < > ? \ |`;
- names that start with a dot, `.` and `..`;
- names longer than 255 UTF-8 bytes;
- complete paths longer than 1023 bytes;
- CJK filenames, because the device file-browser font cannot show them.

Invalid names return HTTP `400`. Upload validation occurs before the destination file is opened. Rejected uploads leave no partial file.

### Sleep Tab

The Sleep tab manages custom sleep screen images in the `/sleep` directory.

![Sleep tab](images/web-sleep.png)

- Each file shows its name and size
- A description at the top tells you to set sleep mode to "Custom" in device settings

#### Uploading Sleep Screens

1. Click the **Upload** button.
2. Select a `.bmp` file from your device.
3. Click **Upload**.
