# PapyriX Game Mod

This fork of [bigbag/papyrix-reader](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-reader),
based on PapyriX **v1.31.0**, adds offline **2048**, **Snake**, **Falling Blocks**, **Nu, Pogodi!**, and **Solitaire (Klondike / Косинка)**
to **Apps > Games**. It includes pause/restart controls, slow and turn-based play,
physical-button controls, and touch controls for the X4 Pro. During a game,
tap the top, bottom, left, or right screen edge for directional input, or use
the **Left | Down | Right** touch pads, with a wider Down button in the middle.
Up remains available from the top edge and physical button.
Nu, Pogodi! adds four basket positions,
direct chute taps, egg-catching scores, and a three-miss game-over rule.

Solitaire adds a 52-card draw-one Klondike game with seven tableau columns,
four foundations, touch/card-stack selection, button navigation, scrolling,
and eight-action undo. See the [Solitaire guide](docs/solitaire.md).

The mod also includes a **Barcode** app with on-screen entry for **Code 128**
and **EAN-13**, plus a **QR Codes** app that displays named codes saved through
the bundled web interface. See the [barcode and QR guide](docs/barcode-qr.md).

The primary device for this mod is the **Xteink X4 Pro (ESP32-S3)**. Build its
firmware with `pio run -e release_x4pro`; the image is
`.pio/build/release_x4pro/firmware.bin`. For X3/X4 (ESP32-C3), use
`pio run -e release_xteink_c3`. These images target different chips; choose the
image for your device.

See [game controls](docs/games.md) and the upstream [firmware update instructions](docs/user_guide.md).
Validation covers game models, menus, touch controls, timers, and layout in
portrait and landscape. The Nu, Pogodi! guide includes its basket controls and
slow/turn-based modes.

The project retains the upstream MIT license and documentation below.

## Solitaire screen previews

These host previews show draw-one Klondike with the seven-column deal,
stock/waste, foundations, and Stock/Undo/Auto controls. Fonts are illustrative;
physical-device gameplay testing is pending.

## Directional touch controls

2048, Snake, and Falling Blocks use **Left | Down | Right**. The centre
Down target is twice as wide as either side target; Up uses the top screen
margin or physical button. This host preview uses illustrative fonts.

## Nu, Pogodi! screen previews

An optional local import uses the original LCD SVG shapes and printed inlay,
with their proportions preserved. Run
`python tools/generate_nu_pogodi_art.py --fetch` before building the firmware.
See [artwork sources and import notes](third_party/nu-pogodi/README.md).
The source assets have no stated redistribution license, so the public repo
contains the renderer/importer and retains pixel drawings when assets are absent.
The previews below show that default pixel-art build.

Catch eggs from four chutes, move the wolf's basket between four positions,
and avoid three misses. Play at a slow automatic pace or advance one step
per basket input. See the [game controls](docs/games.md#nu-pogodi).

These are host previews generated from the game's rendering calls, with
illustrative fonts. Physical-device testing of this game is pending.

<img alt="PapyriX" src="./images/logo-light.jpg" width="160">

PapyriX is firmware for Xteink X3, X4, and X4 Pro e-paper readers.
It uses one ESP32-C3 image for X3/X4 and one ESP32-S3 image for X4 Pro.

> **Warning:** Some Xteink units (for example, units from AliExpress) lock USB flash.
> If USB flash is locked, you cannot update or recover through USB.
> Install, update, and do [emergency recovery](#emergency-recovery) from the SD card.
> Flash through USB only on devices that have unlocked USB.

It is a community project.

## Supported devices

| Device | Release file | Panel |
|---|---|---|
| Xteink X4 | `papyrix-xteink-c3.bin` | 800×480 SSD1677 |
| Xteink X3 | `papyrix-xteink-c3.bin` | 792×528 UC8253 or UC8279 |
| Xteink X4 Pro | `papyrix-x4pro.bin` | 800×480 UC8279 or UC8179 |

See the [device support matrix](docs/device-support-matrix.md) for build targets and hardware services.
Using the wrong binary can drive incorrect pins and can damage hardware.

Page caches use profile-specific folders. Moving an SD card between supported
devices does not reuse incompatible rendered pages.

> **Tip:** The Web UI folder create, upload, and rename functions change supported Unicode names to NFC. Names have a limit of 255 UTF-8 bytes. Full paths have a limit of 1023 bytes. CJK filenames are not supported. The device file-browser UI does not have CJK glyphs. For deep folder trees with supported non-Latin names, use exFAT, not FAT32.

See [the user guide](docs/user_guide.md) for operation procedures.
See the [customization guide](docs/customization.md) for themes and fonts.
Example theme files and font files are in [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples/).

### Installing & Firmware Updates

> Do you need to recover a device that does not start? [Go to emergency recovery](#emergency-recovery).

Download the binary that matches the device:

- X3 or X4: `papyrix-xteink-c3.bin`
- X4 Pro: `papyrix-x4pro.bin`

The usual installation method is
**[papyrix-flasher](https://github.com/bigbag/papyrix-flasher)**:

```bash
papyrix-flasher flash papyrix-xteink-c3.bin
```

Do not flash an S3 image to a C3 device or a C3 image to an S3 device.

**From SD card:** You can also install or update with an SD card:

1. Copy the firmware file as `/firmware.bin` to the root of your SD card.
2. Put the SD card into the device.
3. Go to **Settings > Firmware Update** and press **Run**.

The device flashes the firmware from the SD card and restarts.

#### Emergency Recovery

If the device does not start, copy the firmware as `/force_update.bin` to the SD card.
On the next start, the device flashes the file before it starts the UI.
You do not need to operate the device.

See the [customization guide](docs/customization.md) for more data.

## Development

### Prerequisites

* **PlatformIO Core** (`pio`) or **VS Code + PlatformIO IDE**
* Python 3.12+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for font conversion)
* Node.js 18+ (for sleep screen scripts and logo scripts)
* USB-C data cable
* Xteink X3, X4, or X4 Pro with unlocked USB flashing

Install Node.js dependencies (for sleep screen scripts and logo scripts):
```bash
cd scripts && npm install
```

### Using Nix

If you have [Nix](https://nixos.org/), `shell.nix` supplies all dependencies:

```bash
# Enter development environment
nix-shell

# Or run commands directly
nix-shell --run "make build"
nix-shell --run "make check"
```

First-time Nix setup:
```bash
# Install Nix (if not installed)
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon

# Add nixpkgs channel
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixpkgs
nix-channel --update
```

### Checking out the code

PapyriX uses PlatformIO to build and flash the firmware. Clone the repository:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pliashkou/papyrix

# Or, if you've already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

```sh
# Build development firmware
make build

# Build both release environments
make release

# Build, verify, and package deterministic release files in dist/
make package
```

### Flashing your device

Connect the device through unlocked USB.
Build and flash the release firmware for the device:

```sh
make flash-xteink-c3  # X3 and X4
make flash-x4pro      # X4 Pro
```

On X4 Pro, hold Power throughout flashing.
Release Power after verification completes and the application starts.
Close the serial monitor before flashing.
To select a port:

```sh
PLATFORMIO_UPLOAD_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 make flash-x4pro
```

`make flash-release` and `make upload-release` select X3/X4 only.
To install an existing release binary instead of building it, use:

```sh
# ESP32-C3: X3/X4
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash -z 0x10000 papyrix-xteink-c3.bin

# ESP32-S3: X4 Pro
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 \
  write_flash -z 0x10000 papyrix-x4pro.bin
```

PlatformIO upload remains available for a connected development target:

```sh
pio run -e default --target upload
pio run -e x4pro --target upload
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the device port. Use `COM3` on Windows or
`/dev/tty.usbmodem*` on macOS where applicable.

### Build Scripts

Build scripts are in the `scripts/` directory.

#### Converting fonts

Convert TTF/OTF fonts to the PapyriX `.epdfont` format with Python (you need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

```bash
# Basic conversion (outputs to current directory)
uv run scripts/fontconvert.py my-font -r MyFont-Regular.ttf --2bit

# Full font family with all reader sizes (14, 16, 18pt)
uv run scripts/fontconvert.py my-font -r Regular.ttf -b Bold.ttf --2bit --all-sizes -o /tmp/fonts/

# With Thai script support
uv run scripts/fontconvert.py my-font -r Regular.ttf --2bit --thai -o /tmp/fonts/

# With Arabic script support
uv run scripts/fontconvert.py my-font -r Regular.ttf --2bit --arabic -o /tmp/fonts/

# Generate C header instead of binary (for builtin fonts)
uv run scripts/fontconvert.py my_font 16 Regular.ttf --2bit > my_font_16_2b.h
```

Options: `-r/--regular`, `-b/--bold`, `-i/--italic`, `-o/--output`, `-s/--size`, `--2bit`, `--all-sizes`, `--header`, `--thai`, `--arabic`

See the [customization guide](docs/customization.md) for the full font conversion procedure.

#### Creating sleep screen images

Convert an image to the sleep screen BMP format (run `cd scripts && npm install` first):

```bash
# With Makefile
make sleep-screen INPUT=photo.jpg OUTPUT=sleep.bmp
make sleep-screen INPUT=photo.jpg OUTPUT=sleep.bmp ARGS='--dither --bits 8'

# Or directly
cd scripts && node create-sleep-screen.mjs photo.jpg sleep.bmp --dither --bits 8
```

Options:
- `--orientation portrait|landscape` - Screen orientation (default: portrait)
- `--bits 2|4|8` - Output bit depth (default: 4)
- `--dither` - Enable Floyd-Steinberg dithering
- `--fit contain|cover|stretch` - Resize mode (default: contain)

Copy the output BMP to the `/sleep/` directory or as `/sleep.bmp` on the SD card.

#### Converting logo

Convert an image to a C header for the firmware logo (384x384 monochrome):

```bash
cd scripts && node convert-logo.mjs ../images/logo-light.jpg ../src/images/PapyrixLogo.h
```

Options: `--invert`, `--threshold <0-255>`, `--rotate <0|90|180|270>` (default: `270`)

#### Calibre simulators (development/testing)

Two simulators let you test the Calibre Wireless Device feature with no real hardware:

```bash
cd scripts

# Simulate a PapyriX device (for testing Calibre desktop connection)
node device-simulator.mjs

# Simulate Calibre desktop (for testing device firmware)
node calibre-simulator.mjs
```

The device simulator listens for Calibre broadcasts and can receive books (saved to `scripts/received_books/`). The Calibre simulator sends discovery packets and sends test books to connected devices.

#### Serial monitor

A standalone Go binary reads device logs with no PlatformIO. Pre-built binaries are on the [releases page](https://github.com/pliashkou/papyrix/releases). You can also build from source:

```bash
cd tools/monitor && go build -o monitor .
```

Usage:
```bash
./monitor                                  # Auto-detect port
./monitor -port /dev/ttyACM0               # Explicit port
./monitor -port /dev/ttyACM0 -log out.txt  # Also save to file
./monitor -speed 921600                    # Custom baud rate (default: 115200)
```

#### Reader test (desktop)

A desktop tool tests the content parse pipeline (EPUB, FB2, HTML, TXT, Markdown) with no flash to hardware. Use it to find parse defects, layout defects, or crashes.

```bash
# Build only
make reader-test

# Build and process a book
make reader-test FILE=book.epub OUTPUT=/tmp/cache

# Dump parsed text content of each page
tools/reader-test/build/reader-test --dump book.epub /tmp/cache
```

Options:
- `--dump` — Print the parsed text of each page (use this to verify entity resolution, text extraction, and layout)

### Creating a GitHub release

```sh
# With auto-generated notes from commits
make gh-release VERSION=0.1.1

# With custom notes
make gh-release VERSION=0.1.1 NOTES="Release notes here"
```

### Generating changelog

Make `CHANGELOG.md` from git tags and commit history:

```sh
make changelog
```

This makes a changelog grouped by version tags, with commit messages and author data.

## Internals

PapyriX is made for the ESP32-C3 limit of approximately 380KB RAM. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the architecture.

### Data caching

The device caches book data on the SD card. X4 uses `/.papyrix/cache/`, X3 uses
`/.papyrix/cache/x3/`, and X4 Pro uses `/.papyrix/cache/x4pro/`.
Each device-specific directory contains the book folders shown below.


```

```

To clear cached data, use **Settings > Cleanup** (see [User Guide](docs/user_guide.md)). You can also delete the `.papyrix` directory.

The cache does not clear automatically when you delete a book. If you move a book file, the device uses a new cache directory. This resets the reading progress.

See [file formats](./docs/file-formats.md) for cache records.
See the [rendering pipeline](./docs/rendering-pipeline.md#page-cache) for cache scheduling and ownership.
